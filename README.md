# AspNetCore2.0_Identity_MongoDB_Sample
A sample project configured to use ASP.NET Core identity to use and store user data in MongoDB.
This example uses the a tweaked version of the adapter provided by <a href="https://github.com/g0t4/aspnet-identity-mongo">Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.MongoDB</a> 
in order to be made usable for an Asp ASP.NET Core 2.0 project.

<h1>Usage</h1>
To get things running you will need a MongoDB instance up and running and you will need to edit the connectionstring in the appsettings.json file as well. Please see https://docs.mongodb.com/tutorials/install-mongodb-on-windows/ on how to set up a MongoDB client.
